## DockerHUb

#### Ran the docker push command and uploaded the docker images to docker hub

Pushed the docker image at dockerhub

back-end docker hub images

front-end docker hub images 
https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/lewisawe/cruddur-app/general
![Photos](assets/dockerHubfrontend.png)

In My local machine I pulled the images and did the Docker Run for both apps

```
docker pull lewisawe/cruddur-app:latest
docker pull lewisawe/backend:latest
docker run -p 3000:3000 lewisawe/cruddur-app:latest
docker run -p 4567:4567 lewisawe/backend:latest
```
Managed to make the frontend work, trying to make backend communicate with the frontend in order to show the data
