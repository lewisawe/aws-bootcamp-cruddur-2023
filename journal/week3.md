# Week 3 â€” Decentralized Authentication

## COGNITO

AWS Cognito is a user authentication and authorization service provided by Amazon Web Services (AWS). It allows developers to add user sign-up, sign-in, and access control to their web and mobile applications quickly and easily.

Cognito offers features such as user registration and login, social identity providers (such as Facebook and Google), multi-factor authentication, and user data synchronization across devices. Additionally, it supports both JSON Web Tokens (JWTs) and OAuth 2.0 access tokens for secure access to APIs and resources.

Cognito can also be integrated with other AWS services such as AWS Lambda, Amazon API Gateway, and Amazon S3 to create fully managed serverless applications. It provides a scalable and secure solution for managing user authentication and authorization in modern applications.
