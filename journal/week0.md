# Week 0 â€” Billing and Architecture
## Homework Challenges and Tasks

### 1. Destroy your root account credentials, Set MFA, IAM role
As the I had not configured Access key for the root user, I went on the the second step and set up MFA with google authenticator app.
I then created a IAM User I will be using and set it up with a password, console and billing access.
I Logged into the IAM role set up and configured and downloaded the Access and Secret key
The next step was setting up the gitpod account, using the AWS configure, then saved the configurations in the ENV of gitpod
